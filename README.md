# Webook - Single Page Education Website

(This project is an adapted version of the original [one](https://github.com/SM8UTI/Webook-online-education-website).) 


<br/>

## Overview
In this project, we aim to build and deploy a single-page web application (named ‚ÄúWebook‚Äù) that enables users to explore the marketing information of online courses provided by Webook. This application presents users with an HTML-based interface with a RESTful web service on the backend to submit their enquiries.

<br/>
The main components of the website are: 

- Course introduction, Lecturer introduction, FAQs, Contact messages and other functions, where:
    - Contact messages contains the most important feature of this application

<br/>
Specially, this application integrates several AWS cloud services including:

- **AWS Amplify**: providing continuous deployment and hosting of static web resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- **API Gateway** and **Lambda**: building a public backend API that receives data and triggers a Lambda function to store the data into the database
- **DynamoDB**: providing a persistent layer where data can be stored by the Lambda function
- **IAM**: providing secure access for the Lambda function to store data into DynamoDB
- **CloudWatch**: monitoring application performance and resource use
